# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [WIP 3.0.0] - 2025-Aug-08

### Deprecated

- Removed unused and undocumented route options: `filter_by_sources`, `filter_by_object`
  - These features are instead avalable as part of the new filter scripts 
- Removed a feature that would automatically replace clips based on whenever the audio files match the name of the vanilla clips
  - If you have an audio pack that used this feature, you now have to explicitly do the replacement in the audio pack configuration

### Added

- Added a route effect to force audio sources to loop even if the original tracks didn't loop
  - usable using the `force_loop` effect: `source = replacement ~ force_loop : true`
- Added multiple previously unavailable route effects. Their effects are documented in `AudioPackConfig.cs`. The full list of effects is now as follows:
  - `link_overlay_and_replacement` - true/false
  - `relative_replacement_effects` - true/false
  - `overlay_stops_if_source_stops` - true/false
  - `relative_overlay_effects` - true/false
  - `overlays_ignore_restarts` - true/false
  - `replacement_weight` / `weight` - number
  - `volume` - number
  - `pitch` - number
  - `force_loop` - true/false
- Added the `filter_script` parameter for routes, which specified a filter method to use for filtering within the route 
- Added the `target_group_script` parameter for routes, which specified a dynamic target group to use for rerouting music that's already playing
- Added basic JavaScript scripting for audio packs. Scripts need to be placed in `modaudio.js` next to the audio pack configuration
  - This is currently used for specifying custom filtering for routes and dynamic targeting
  - Inline scripts can also be specified when using TOML or JSON formats (not __routes.txt, you have to specify methods from `modaudio.js` for that one)

## [2.2.2] - 2025-May-22

### Fixed

- Fixed replacement weight not working as expected with `source = replacement / weight` routes
- Switched from UnityWebRequestMultimedia to NAudio for loading audio files (previously was only used for streaming)
  - This should fix an issue where some MP3 files wouldn't load / play correctly, but audio might load slower as a result
- Fixed mod crashing if an exception is thrown while reading route files
- Fixed warning log spam when EasySettings version would differ from the expected version (should now warn at most once)

### Changed

- Audio packs should now be sorted by display name in EasySettings

## [2.2.1] - 2025-Mar-31

### Fixed

- Fixed an error that would occur rarely when sounds are stopped
- (Hopefully) Fixed an error that would occur rarely when reloading audio

## [2.2.0] - 2025-Mar-30

### Added

- Added a button in EasySettings that opens the custom / user audio pack folder for easy access

### Fixed

- Fixed some overlay sounds being interrupted mid-playthrough when played from components that have particle system components
  - Technial details: The sound is played from a game object higher in the hierarchy as a workaround for the game object being disabled by the particle system
- Fixed routing failing occasionally when using `___nothing___` as a replacement
- Fixed game object names being erroneously set to "oneshot" for display purposes
  - It will now use the correct object name and instead append "oneshot" to logged lines for played audio

## [2.1.0] - 2025-Mar-29

### Added

- Added an effect option "overlays_ignore_restarts" for `__routes.txt` routes (`originalClip @ overlayClip ~ overlays_ignore_restarts : true`)
  - Settings this as true will make it so that an overlay sound is played only once if an audio source is restarted multiple times.

### Changed

- Slightly improved load times by skipping loading audio data for audio packs that are disabled
- Mod assembly now uses an embedded PDB instead of a separate PDB file for debugging

### Fixed

- Fixed some playOnAwake sources being logged an extra time in the console
- Fixed pitch and volume being tracked and applied incorrectly for cast effect sounds

## [2.0.1] - 2025-Mar-19

### Changed

- LogAudioPlayed is now false by default
- The PDB is now supplied alongside the mod for debug purposes

### Fixed

- Fixed crash caused by audio sources with no output audio mixer group
- Added a bit of error handling

## [2.0.0] - 2025-Mar-16

### Added

- Added volume and pitch controls for tracks
- Added "overlay" sounds that play alongside a track instead of replacing it completely
- Rewrote the __routes.txt pack format to support the changes from above
- Added a modaudio.config.json pack format that allows full control over pack loading
- Improved load performance by streaming audio for large clips (over 1MB) that use .ogg, .mp3 or .wav
- Added support for Nessie's EasySettings mod
- Added support for reloading audio packs when using EasySettings, allowing you to add, remove and edit packs while you're playing
- Added support for toggling audio packs on and off when using EasySettings
- Added options for toggling console logging on and off when using EasySettings
- Improved audio logging, and added a configuration setting to filter out audio that plays too far from the player (when the main player is available)
- Added options to filter logged audio based on its audio group

### Changed

- Audio logging now includes way more information in a concise manner

### Fixed

- Fixed post-boss defeat music not being replaceable 
- Fixed functionality being broken for audio sources that utilized `playOnAwake` for playing

### Removed

- OverrideCustomAudio option has been removed. It may or may not return in the future, but you can always manually edit the packs you download in case you need adjustments

## [1.1.0] - 2025-Jan-01

### Added

- You can now specify multiple audio files per source clip in __routes.txt. ModAudio will play one at random, based on their weights.
- Each clip in __routes.txt can now specify a weight using the format `source = replacement / weight` (where weight is a decimal number, i.e. `1.0`). This is used for random rolls when there are multiple clips present.
- You can now use the `___default___` identifier when replacing audio. This allows you to include the vanilla audio as a clip that should be played randomly.
- Added an `OverrideCustomAudio` option that can be used to override any custom audio from mods with whatever you specify in ModAudio itself.
- `__routes.txt` now supports line comments. Lines starting with `#` will be treated as a comment and ignored.

## [1.0.4] - 2024-Dec-28

### Changed

- Improved audio loading from root folder, it will now also load audio from root if there's at least one clip with a known vanilla name

## [1.0.3] - 2024-Dec-27

### Changed

- The mod will now load assets from mods that don't have a DLL plugin. It will load any audio from the "audio" folder (i.e. `BepInEx/plugins/Your-Mod/audio`) if it exists. It will also load audio from the root folder (`BepInEx/plugins/Your-Mod/`) if there is a `__routes.txt` file present

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue related to using the mod without any audio under `ModAudio/audio`

## [1.0.2] - 2024-Dec-23

### Changed

- Removed NAudio dependency in favor of UnityWebRequestMultimedia

### Fixed

- Audio played via `AudioSource.PlayOneShot` should now be replaced correctly

## [1.0.1] - 2024-Dec-23

### Added

- Option to enable verbose logging of audio sources that are being replaced, and audio sources that are loaded in

### Changed

- Improve reliability of audio replacement when scenes are loaded

## [1.0.0] - 2024-Dec-22

### Changed
